Welcome to the AWS CodeStar sample web application
==================================================

This sample code helps get you started with a simple Java web application
deployed by AWS CodeDeploy to an Amazon EC2 server.

What's Here
-----------

This sample includes:

* README.md - this file
* appspec.yml - this file is used by AWS CodeDeploy when deploying the web
  application to EC2
* buildspec.yml - this file is used by AWS CodeBuild to build the web
  application
* pom.xml - this file is the Maven Project Object Model for the web application
* src/ - this directory contains your Java application source files
* scripts/ - this directory contains scripts used by AWS CodeDeploy when
  installing and deploying your application on the Amazon EC2 instance


Getting Started
---------------

These directions assume you want to develop on your local computer, and not
from the Amazon EC2 instance itself. If you're on the Amazon EC2 instance, the
virtual environment is already set up for you, and you can start working on the
code.

To work on the sample code, you'll need to clone your project's repository to your
local computer. If you haven't, do that first. You can find instructions in the
AWS CodeStar user guide.

1. Install maven.  See https://maven.apache.org/install.html for details.

2. Install tomcat.  See https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/setup.html for
   details.

3. Build the application.

        $ mvn -f pom.xml compile
        $ mvn -f pom.xml package

4. Copy the built application to the Tomcat webapp directory.  The actual
   location of that directory will vary depending on your platform and
   installation.

        $ cp target/ROOT.war <tomcat webapp directory>

4. Restart your tomcat server

5. Open http://127.0.0.1:8080/ in a web browser to view your application.

What Do I Do Next?
------------------

Once you have a virtual environment running, you can start making changes to
the sample Java web application. We suggest making a small change to
/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/views/index.jsp first, so you can see how changes
pushed to your project's repository are automatically picked up by your project
pipeline and deployed to the Amazon EC2 instance. (You can watch the pipeline
progress on your project dashboard.) Once you've seen how that works, start
developing your own code, and have fun!
